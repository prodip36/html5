               <b> Liverpool passed a major test of their Premier League title credentials to move back to the top of the table by beating Chelsea 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday.</b>
               <p>Mohamed Salah's penalty and Curtis Jones' winner made it 10 wins in 11 games for the Reds since Arne Slot took charge. <br><br>

                Nicolas Jackson briefly levelled for Chelsea in the second half, but they slipped to a first league defeat since losing to Manchester City on the opening weekend of the season.
                <br><br>
                Victory takes Liverpool one point ahead of City and four clear of Arsenal, who they face at the Emirates next weekend.
                <br><br>
                Chelsea are now seven points off the top down in sixth, but there was plenty cause for optimism for the Blues from a performance that stretched Liverpool to their limits.
                <br><br>
                Liverpool's only defeat under Slot came to Nottingham Forest following September's international break.
                <br><br>
                The Dutchman responded by this time leaving all of his South American internationals -- Alexis Mac Allister, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez -- on the bench after their exertions in recent days across the Atlantic.
                <br><br>
                The decision to hand Jones just his second league start of the season proved an inspired one as the England international won Liverpool's penalty and scored the decisive goal.
                <br><br>
                Chelsea were fortunate still to have 11 men on the field after just six minutes when Tosin Adarabioyo hauled down Diogo Jota.
                <br><br>
                The Portugal international was still a long way from goal but the incident was almost identical to the one that saw Arsenal defender William Saliba sent-off in a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday.
                <br><br>
                Having survived that scare, Chelsea settled nicely into their rhythm and pushed the home side back by dominating possession.
                <br><br>
                However, Liverpool's pace on the break was a constant threat and Chelsea were caught out when Salah fed Jones, who was chopped down by Levi Colwill.<br><br></p>

                <b>Manchester City snatched a controversial 2-1 win at Wolves as John Stones' last-gasp goal was given after a VAR review to send the champions to the top of the Premier League on Sunday.</b>
                <p>
                    Pep Guardiola's side trailed to Jorgen Strand Larsen's surprise opener for Wolves early in the first half.
<br><br>
Josko Gvardiol dragged City back on level terms before the interval and, with just seconds left in stoppage-time, Stones headed the visitors to a dramatic sixth win in eight league games this season.
<br><br>
Bottom of the table Wolves claimed Stones' goal should have been disallowed for offside and interference by Bernardo Silva on keeper Jose Sa.
<br><br>
But referee Chris Kavanagh ignored their protests after consulting the pitchside monitor.
<br><br>
City are two points clear of previous leaders Liverpool, who can reclaim pole position with a victory against Chelsea later on Sunday.
<br><br>
Chasing a fifth successive English title, Guardiola's men have set a new club record as their unbeaten run in the league reached 31 games since their loss to Aston Villa in December.
<br><br>
In English top-flight history, only six times has a side gone more than 30 matches without losing, most recently Liverpool's run of 44 games from 2019 to 2020.
<br><br>
City are undefeated in 11 games in all competitions this season after avenging last season's 2-1 defeat on their previous visit to Wolves.
<br><br>
The champions were rocked after just seven minutes when Nelson Semedo's pin-point low cross reached Strand Larsen at the far post and the striker eluded Stones for a simple close-range finish.<br><br>
